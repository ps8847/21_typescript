		 : due to same name files it gives error in the .ts file

		: just write >> export {} in the .ts file and re ren it 

* what is watch 
		: normally we need to return the "tsc app.js" command to reflect the changes into the .js file
		 but if we want to make changes into .js file without rerun of the cmmands , jus write this command  >>
		 "tsc app.ts --watch"

* run file without browser 
		: run the command "node app.js"
